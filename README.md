# Disaster Recovery Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the **estimated recovery days after a disaster** using machine learning techniques.  
It is built using **Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit** and is intended for learning and demonstration purposes.

## 📌 Project Overview
Natural disasters cause significant disruption and loss.  
This project aims to analyze disaster-related data and predict recovery time based on multiple factors.

---

## Dataset
- File: `global_disaster_response_2018_2024.csv`
- Contains historical disaster data from 2018 to 2024
- Features include disaster severity, impact metrics, and recovery-related indicators

---

## Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm: Regression-based ML model
- Trained using `scikit-learn`
- Saved model file: `disaster_recovery_model.pkl`

---

##  Streamlit Web App
- File: `global.py`
- Provides a simple UI to:
  - Input disaster parameters
  - Predict recovery duration
  - Visualize insights
